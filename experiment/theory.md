Theory:

1.	Amplitude modulation: Modulation is a process of translating information signal from low band frequency to high band frequency that is suits the transmission medium. Information signal is usually of low frequency, so it cannot travel far. It needs a carrier signal of higher frequency for long distance destination. The inputs are carrier and information (modulating) signals while the output is called the modulated signal. Amplitude Modulation (AM) refers to the modulation technique where the carrier’s amplitude is varied in accordance to the instantaneous value of the modulating or baseband signal’s amplitude. An AM signal is represented as:

Sinusoidal carrier wave C(t) given as:
c(t) = A cos wct	A = Max amplitude of the carrier wave
Wc = carrier frequency
AM wave can be expressed as:
s(t) = x(t) cos wct + A cos wct s(t) = [A + x(t) ] cos wct

2.	Modulation Index: The amount by which the amplitude of the carrier wave increases and decreases depends on the amplitude of the information signal and is known as modulation index or depth of modulation. The extent of amplitude variation in AM about a unmodulated carrier amplitude is measured in terms of a factor called modulation index.

m = Vmax-Vmin	X 100 % Vmax+ Vmin
3.	Double side band transmitter: The transmitter circuit produces the AM signal which is used to carry information over transmission to the receiver.
