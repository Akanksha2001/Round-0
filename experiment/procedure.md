1.	Connections are made for the AM Modulator and Demodulator as shown in the circuit diagrams.
2.	Frequency of the input carrier is fixed at constant amplitude of 1 volt and 150 KHz.
3.	A message signal of 1 KHz at 0.5 volt amplitude is applied at the modulating signal input.
4.	The Vmax and Vmin are measured and tabulated to calculate the Modulation Index m
5.	The amplitude of the message signal is varied in steps till the Vmin reaches the minimum.
6.	The same set of amplitude values are used for two or three modulating frequencies and values tabulated.
7.	The maximum value of m is observed to be 1.
8.	The demodulated message signal is observed from the output of the Envelope Detector and tabulated in the demodulator side of the tabulation..
9.	A selection of RC network is important for a faithful recovery of the message signal.
10.	All optimum parameters like Vcc are noted down.
