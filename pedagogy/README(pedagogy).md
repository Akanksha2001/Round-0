#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
The students know the concept of interference, value of wavelength of light source used and relation for finding the wavelength of light and refractive index of the liquid using Newton’s ring experiment. They do the experimentation based on the formula, trial and error and learn from it, finally analyzing results with standard value.
#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

<h1>To study DSB/SSB amplitude modulation.</h1>
<h1>To determine its modulation factor.</h1>
