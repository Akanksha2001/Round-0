#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
The students know the concept of interference, value of wavelength of light source used and relation for finding the wavelength of light and refractive index of the liquid using Newton’s ring experiment. They do the experimentation based on the formula, trial and error and learn from it, finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 Students will identify the various components as per the arrangement to construct the setup. With this, they will get concept and purpose of each component. They will set the travelling microscope to get the properly resolved image. The students put the cross wire on specific rings. Based on readings, they will get the diameters of the rings. These values will be put in the formula from which wavelength of light and refractive index of the liquid shall be calculated. After performing the experiment, student shall give answer to the questions asked.
