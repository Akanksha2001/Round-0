Experiment 1: DSB/SSB amplitude modulation

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on DSB-SC which is a double sideband suppressed carrier modulation and SSB-SC is single sideband suppressed carrier modulation.
When amplitude modulation is carried out, the modulating signal spectrum is shifted to the carrier frequency band. DSB-SC is so named because the modulating signal extends symmetrically on both sides of the carrier wave. SSB-SC is DSB-SC with only one side band.

The objective of the experiment is to study DSB/SSB amplitude modulation and determine its modulation factor.
