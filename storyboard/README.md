## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: DSB/SSB amplitude modulation

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on DSB-SC which is a double sideband suppressed carrier modulation and SSB-SC is single sideband suppressed carrier modulation.
When amplitude modulation is carried out, the modulating signal spectrum is shifted to the carrier frequency band. DSB-SC is so named because the modulating signal extends symmetrically on both sides of the carrier wave. SSB-SC is DSB-SC with only one side band.

The objective of the experiment is to study DSB/SSB amplitude modulation and determine its modulation factor.
### 2. Story:

In 1717, Sir Isaac Newton studied the rings pattern generated due to interference of light. These rings are known as Newtonâ€™s rings and they arise from the interference of light reflected from the glass surfaces at the air film between the lens and the slide. Newton's Ring Apparatus is one of the basic experiment in Engineering Physics at under graduation level. With the help of this apparatus, the wave nature of light is confirmed and parameters like wavelength of light and refractive index of liquids can calculated. The experiment is based on the phenomenon of interference of light waves obtained from monochromatic and coherent (of same frequency and constant phase difference).
The phenomenon of Newton's ring, is the result of interference between the partially reflected and partially transmitted rays from both the lower curved surface of Plano-convex lens as well as upper surfaces of the glass plate. When viewed with a monochromatic source, it appears as a series of concentric, alternating bright and dark concentric rings centered at the point of contact between the two surfaces. The thickness of the film is symmetrical and increases outwards from the point of contact.
A series of rings are seen around the point of contact between the Plano-convex lens and the circular glass plate. These rings appear in the field of view of telescope. The interference fringe pattern is a pattern of concentric circles, the diameter of which student will measure with a travelling microscope (which has a Vernier scale). The cross wire of the travelling microscope is to be put at the specific ring in tangential position and the reading is to be inserted in the observation table. The readings are to be taken in one direction from left to right or right to left. After filling all the readings, diameters will be calculated. A graph is plotted on which ring number is X-axis and diameter square is on Y-axis. This graph is a straight line having a positive slope, passing through origin. Value of wavelength of light is to be calculated by using the formula.
By studying the ring pattern, we can determine the wavelength of the monochromatic light and also the refractive index of a given transparent liquid medium present in the wedge-shaped film.
